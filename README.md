# Trading floor
The explosive technological revolution 4.0 requires financial products and services to be improved, digitized, and applied new technologies, most notably artificial intelligence (AI). However, the application of AI is still a challenge, of which the biggest challenge is getting people to accept the transition from the traditional model to the model of using AI. In this study, I will analyze and make recommendations on persuading traders to engage more with AI tools when it comes evaluating securities.

## Network-related obstacles to the diffusion of positive opinions about AI in the trading floor
Diffusion model has been carried into investigation, with pay-off for each nodes is calculated as their own preference for AI. According to the Granovetter threshold model, the “threshold” is “the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so”. In this research, threshold is set up to define “early adopters” (orange nodes), who preference for AI is above threshold value. In next stage, the adoption of AI can be facilitated under the diffusion of knowledge and preference for AI between traders, and “new adopters” (red nodes) may appear.

_Figure 5.1 Diffusion of AI preference with threshold = 10_

In this research, 3 level of thresholds are tested: 6, 8, 10. Thresholds below than 6 are not tested because it would hardly to force someone with preference for AI below than 6 to adopt them. There are similarity among 3 diffusion, which is, diffusion mainly occurs around early adopters. This is explained by traders in the same community tend to interact with each other more as well as have higher similarity. When a trader acts as an early adopter, it becomes easier for them to spread a positive opinion about AI in their own community.

However, the number of new adopters at each threshold is quite small. Barriers for positive AI opinion diffusion is human. As mentioned above, the main preference for AI is neutral, even there are quite a few negative opinions about AI, making the pay-off for those traders to accept a change of opinion is lower than if they keep their opinion. Besides, when diffusion between communities occurs, it is quite difficult for positive AI opinion to pass through or affect nodes with negative opinion, when mainly around them there are many people who have similar opinions about it. don't appreciate AI.

## Recommendation to promote the diffusion of positive opinions about AI in the trading floor
The importance of knowledge network and physical layout to traders opinion has been proved though out this research. Therefore, in order to promote the diffusion of positive opinions about AI, I recommend that investment banks should:

1. Change position of traders with high AI preference, especially those who rate 10 for AI, interspersed with traders who have negative opinion about it. Because as demonstrated above, these people will help create a community with people around, spreading their positive opinions about AI to their focal.
2. With a threshold of 6, managers can suggest traders with AI preference above this threshold to use AI, turning them into “early adopters” in our model. First, this is a reasonable threshold because after the diffusion phase, nearly half of the trading floor will adopt AI (Figure 5.1). Second, for a threshold lower than 6, we will need to force more people to adopt AI, some of whom also don't like it, so implementing policies is complicated and difficult. Third, this is already a higher-than-average preference for AI, so the manager can be smarter in implementing the policies, as well as maintaining trader’s job satisfaction.
